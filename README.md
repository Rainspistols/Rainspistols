### Hi there 👋

I’m a senior front-end developer specializing in React with a solid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript foundation. I have a strong track record in meeting deadlines and frequently lead teams, focusing on planning, schedules, and project delivery. Lately, I’ve been transitioning into managerial roles, driven by my interest in team and project management.

I believe in continuous integration to align teams, enable consistent changes, and bridge the gap between stakeholders and engineers. Clear documentation is essential for smooth collaboration.

I freelanced on Upwork early in my career, earning a “Top Rated” badge with 100% client satisfaction. This expanded my skills in databases, backend frameworks, and DevOps while providing direct communication with users and founders, strengthening my understanding of aligning technical solutions with business goals.

I enjoy optimizing processes and solving complex problems with simple solutions.
